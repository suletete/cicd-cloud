# GitHub Actions and CI/CD Course: Deployment Pipelines and Cloud Platforms  
## Introduction to GitHub Actions: Deployment and Cloud Integration

Welcome to our comprehensive course on **GitHub Actions**, designed to equip you with the skills to automate your deployment pipelines and integrate your applications with cloud platforms. Whether you're a beginner developer, a DevOps enthusiast, or a seasoned engineer looking to enhance your CI/CD workflows, this course will guide you through essential tools, concepts, and practices to streamline your software delivery process.

## Why This Course Matters: The Pilot Analogy ‚úàÔ∏è

Imagine you're a pilot navigating a high-tech airliner ‚Äî a complex system requiring precision and synchronization. In this analogy:

- Your **codebase** is the airliner.  
- **GitHub Actions** is the control system automating operations.  
- Each **commit, push, or merge** is like adjusting the controls to guide the aircraft.  
- The **destination**? A successful, error-free deployment.

Flying without automation is like manually steering the plane without autopilot ‚Äî possible, but risky and exhausting. With GitHub Actions, your deployments become smoother and more reliable, allowing you to focus on high-level decisions while trusting the "autopilot" to handle the repetitive tasks.

## Lesson 1: Introduction to Deployment Pipelines

### Objectives
- Understand the stages of a deployment pipeline.
- Explore common deployment strategies.

### Key Concepts

**Deployment Pipeline Stages**  
1. **Development**: Local code writing and unit testing  
2. **Integration**: Merging code into a shared repository  
3. **Testing**: Running automated test suites  
4. **Staging**: Deploying to a pre-production environment  
5. **Production**: Final release to end-users  

**Deployment Strategies**  
- **Blue-Green Deployment**: Switch traffic between two identical environments.  
- **Canary Releases**: Gradually roll out to a subset of users.  
- **Rolling Deployment**: Replace old versions in batches over time.

---

## Lesson 2: Automated Releases and Versioning

### Objectives
- Implement automated versioning.
- Set up GitHub Actions for managing software releases.

---

### Semantic Versioning (SemVer)

Use the format `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`. For example, `1.4.2`:
- `MAJOR`: Breaking changes
- `MINOR`: New features
- `PATCH`: Bug fixes  
üîó [Learn More](https://semver.org/)

---

### GitHub Actions for Versioning

```yaml
name: Bump version and tag
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    name: Create Tag
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Bump version and push tag
        uses: anothrNick/github-tag-action@1.26.0
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          DEFAULT_BUMP: patch
```

> ‚úÖ This workflow auto-increments the patch version on every push to `main`.

---

### Create GitHub Releases Automatically

```yaml
on:
  push:
    tags:
      - '*'

jobs:
  build:
    name: Create Release
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Create Release
        id: create_release
        uses: actions/create-release@v1
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        with:
          tag_name: ${{ github.ref }}
          release_name: Release ${{ github.ref }}
```

> üéâ This workflow creates a GitHub release whenever a tag is pushed.

---

## Lesson 3: Deploying to Cloud Platforms

### Objectives
- Set up GitHub Actions for cloud deployment.
- Configure environments for different deployment stages.

---

### Step-by-Step Deployment (Example: AWS)

**Step 1: Choose a Cloud Provider**  
Select based on your project‚Äôs needs:
- [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/)
- [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/)
- [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/)

---

**Step 2: Create the GitHub Actions Workflow**

```yaml
name: Deploy to AWS
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Set up AWS credentials
        uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v1
        with:
          aws-access-key-id: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
          aws-secret-access-key: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
          aws-region: us-west-2

      - name: Deploy to AWS
        run: |
          # Add deployment logic here (e.g., AWS CLI commands)
```

---

**Step 3: Configure Secrets and Environments**

- Store credentials securely in GitHub Secrets.
- Use environment variables to configure settings.
- You can separate workflows for dev, staging, and production environments.
